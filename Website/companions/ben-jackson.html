      <p><a href="index.html">Ben first appears in the First Doctor serial <em>The War Machines</em>, when he meets Polly and Dodo in a London nightclub called the<em>Inferno</em>. As an Able Seaman serving in the Royal Navy, aboard HMS <em>Teazer</em>, Ben is feeling depressed and angry because he has a six-month shore posting while his ship is deployed to the West Indies, but Polly and Dodo try to cheer him up. When Polly is accosted by another patron in the Inferno, Ben comes to her rescue. Eventually, Ben and Polly aid the Doctor in his fight against the rogue artificial intelligence known as WOTAN. Afterward, Ben and Polly are the bearers of the news of Dodo's decision to stay in 1966 to the Doctor, and accidentally get carried away in the TARDIS when they try to return Dodo's key to the time machine.</a></p>
