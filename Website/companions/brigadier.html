      <p><strong><a href="index.html">Brigadier Sir Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart, CMG,[2] CBE,[3] DSO</a></strong><a href="#">,[4] generally and affectionally referred to simply as <strong>the Brigadier</strong>, is a fictional character in the British science fiction television series <em>Doctor Who</em>, created by writers Mervyn Haisman andHenry Lincoln and played by Nicholas Courtney.[5] He is one of the founders of UNIT (United Nations Intelligence Taskforce, later Unified Intelligence Taskforce), an international organization that defends Earth from alien threats, and serves as commander of the British contingent. Presented at first as reticent to accept the continuing aid of the Doctor, over time the Brigadier became one of the Doctor's greatest friends and his principal ally in defending the Earth.</a></p>
      <p><a href="#">Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart's ancestry goes back to Scotland, according to dialogue in <em>Terror of the Zygons</em>. He first encounters the Second Doctor in <em>The Web of Fear</em>(1968), when Lethbridge-Stewart is a colonel in the Scots Guards commanding a British Army detachment sent to investigate the Yeti in the London Underground. By his next appearance in <em>The Invasion</em> (1968), he had been promoted to Brigadier and was working with UNIT. When the Doctor was forcibly regenerated and exiled to Earth, Lethbridge-Stewart gave him a position as UNIT's scientific advisor after he helped defeat the Auton invasion. Other military members of UNIT included Captain Mike Yates, Sergeant Benton and Royal Navy Lieutenant Harry Sullivan.</a><br />
