      <p>The <strong>Ood</strong> are a fictional alien species with telepathic abilities from the long-running science fiction series <em>Doctor Who</em>. In the series' narrative, they live in the distant future (circa 42nd century).</p>
      <p>Whilst the Ood initially appear as a slave race who become hostile, over the course of the stories they are shown to be a naturally peaceful race, and by <em>The End of Time</em> have progressed to becoming an advanced civilisation which the Doctor thinks is impossible to have happened in the time span that it did (100 years from the end of their enslavement).</p>
      <p>The Ood are humanoid in appearance with tentacles on the lower portions of their faces. The Ood are a telepathic race, as such they require a &quot;translation sphere&quot; to communicate with non-telepathic creatures.[1] The sphere is connected to the Ood via a tube that originally connected their external brains to their body. Humans in the future would physically remove their hind brains and fix the translator sphere where the brain used to be. There appears to be no gender differentiation among the Ood, though the Doctor seems to be able to determine their gender. When Donna refers to a dying Ood as an &quot;it&quot;, the Doctor replies that the Ood is &quot;a 'he', not an 'it'&quot;.[2] The Ood say they require no names or titles as they are connected to a hive mind and function as one unit, but they do have designations given to them by humans such as &quot;Ood 1 Alpha 1&quot; or &quot;Ood Sigma&quot; to differentiate them. The Ood are empaths, sharing among themselves a low-level telepathic communication field. When reaching out with their telepathic fields, it can be heard as singing. This ability has made them susceptible to telepathic control, and in several episodes they are shown to be controlled by a stronger telepathic force.</p>
