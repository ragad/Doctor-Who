      <p>The <strong>Sontarans</strong> are a fictional extraterrestrial race of humanoids from the British science fiction television series <em>Doctor Who</em>, and also seen in spin-off series <em>The Sarah Jane Adventures</em>. A warrior race who live to kill, they are characterised by their ruthlessness and fearlessness of death.They were created by writer Robert Holmes. </p>
<p>The Sontarans are a race of humanoids with a stocky build, greenish brown skin, a distinctive dome-shaped head, and they have only three fingers on each hand. Their musculature is designed for load-bearing rather than leverage, because of the significant amount of gravity on their home planet. Ross Jenkins in &quot;The Sontaran Stratagem&quot; describes a Sontaran as resembling &quot;a talking baked potato&quot;. Sontarans come from a large, dense planet named Sontar in the &quot;southern spiral arm of the galaxy&quot; which has a very strong gravitational field, which explains their compact stocky form.[1] They are far stronger than humans, and in the recent series are shorter than the average human male.</p>
